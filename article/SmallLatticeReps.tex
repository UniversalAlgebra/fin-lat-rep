\begin{abstract}
  This article describes various methods for representing a
  finite lattice as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra or for proving
  that such a representation exists. Using these methods, we show that with one
  possible exception every lattice with at most seven elements is isomorphic to
  the congruence lattice of a finite algebra.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%the problem
%we investigate methods of showing that certain lattices are representable
%we show every lattice with 7 or less elements is representable with one
%possible exception.
%minimal, group (P^5), etc. 
%also we have extend P^5 and McKenzie results on conditions that
%force the min rep to be a group action. Also we have conditions
%guaranteeing a group action represents must be transitive.

By the Gratz\"er-Schmidt Theorem every algebraic, and hence
every finite, lattice is the congruence lattice of an algebra. 
But the algebras in this construction are always infinite
even when the lattice is finite. This leaves the question:
\emph{is every finite lattice isomorphic to the congruence
lattice of a finite algebra?} In 1980 P.~P. \Palfy and P.~\Pudlak
reduced this to a group theoretic problem by showing the following
two statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Every finite lattice is isomorphic to the congruence
lattice of a finite algebra.
\item
Every finite lattice is
isomorphic to an interval in the subgroups lattice of a finite 
group.
\end{enumerate}


If $L$ is isomorphic to the lattice of subgroups of $G$
containing a subgroup $H$, then $L$ is isomorphic to the congruence
lattice of the algebra whose elements are the left cosets of $H$
and whose operations are left multiplication by elements of~$G$;
that is, the group action of $G$ on the left cosets of~$H$;
see~\cite{alvi:1987}.
However the \Palfy-\Pudlak theorem does not prove that if 
a particular lattice $L$
is a congruence lattice of a finite lattice that it 
is (isomorphic to) an interval of a subgroup lattice of a finite
group (although the opposite implication is obviously true) so
it is possible that there is a congruence lattice $L$ of a finite
algebra that is not an interval sublattice of a finite group.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  NOTATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Notation}

Throughout this paper, we use $\sL$ to denote the class of finite lattices that
are isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite algebras. 
We call the lattices that belong to $\sL$ \emph{representable} lattices.
A lattice is denoted by $\bL = \<L, \meet, \join\>$, where $L$
is the universe of elements of the lattice.  However, unless the context
calls for emphasizing that this is an algebraic structure, we often
refer to a lattice by the name of its universe (as in the next paragraph).

Let $L$ be a lattice and suppose $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are members of $L$.  
We denote by $\lb \alpha, \beta \rb$ the sublattice of $L$ consisting of all
elements in $L$ that lie above $\alpha$ and below $\beta$.  
That is, 
$\lb \alpha, \beta \rb = 
\{\theta \in L \mid \alpha \leq \theta \leq \beta\}$.
(If $\alpha \nleq \beta$, then $\lb \alpha, \beta \rb = \emptyset$.)

For a lattice (or, more generally, a partially ordered set) 
$L$, the \emph{dual} of $L$, denoted
$L'$, is the lattice (poset) with the inverse order. That is, 
$x \leq y$ holds in $L$ if and only if $y \leq x$ holds in $L'$. 
The dual of $L$ can be depicted by flipping the Hasse diagram
for $L$ upside down. 
In a broader sense, two lattices (posets) are also said to be duals if they are
dually isomorphic.
Although we often denote the dual of $L$ by $L'$, on some occasions it is more
convenient to use an operator notation, such as $\partial L$, to denote the dual of
$L$.

\section{Closure properties of the class of representable lattices}
\label{sec:clos-prop-class}
This section describes some
\emph{closure properties}
of the class $\sL$. % of representable lattices. 
By closure properties, we mean the following: if $\sansO$ is an operation that can
be applied to a lattice or collection of lattices, we say that $\sL$ is
\emph{closed under $\sansO$} provided $\sansO(\sK) \subseteq \sL$ for all 
$\sK\subseteq \sL$. For example, if 
$\sansS(\sK)$ is all sublattices of lattices in $\sK$, 
it is unknown whether $\sL$ is closed under $\sansS$.  
If this were known to be true, then the 
\emph{finite lattice representation problem} would be solved.
The congruence lattice of the algebra consisting of a
set $X$ with no operations is the lattice of all equivalence relations on $X$,
which we denote by $\EqX$.
By a celebrated theorem of \Pudlak and \Tuma~\cite{Pudlak:1980}, for every finite
lattice $L$ there is a finite set $X$ such that $L\leq \EqX$.  Therefore, $\sL$
would contain all finite lattices if it were closed under $\sansS$.


The following is a list of operations under which $\sL$ is known to be closed,
along with the names of those who first (or independently) proved them.  We
discuss some of these results in greater detail later in this section.
The class $\sL$ of lattices isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite
algebras is closed under the following operations:

\item\label{item:0} principal filters: all elements above a given element (the
correspondence theorem~\cite{Bergman2012}),

\item\label{item:2} interval sublattices (follows from~(\ref{item:1}), see Remark a. below),

\item  parallel sums (John Snow~\cite{Snow:2000}, 2000), 
\item\label{item:6} certain sublattices of lattices in $\sL$ -- namely, those which
  are obtained as a union of a filter and an ideal of a lattice in
  $\sL$ (John Snow~\cite{Snow:2000}, 2000).

\begin{remarks}\
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
  \item 
  The first two items combine to show that $\sL$ is closed under
  principal ideals and this fact, together with~\eqref{item:1}, 
  proves~\eqref{item:2}.
  
  
  %The first item in the list above says that if $L$ is representable then so is
  %the dual of $L$. It follows from this that every interval sublattice of a
  %representable lattice is also representable.  
  %Indeed, suppose $L$ is representable, say, $L\cong \bar{L} =\Con\bA$.
  %Let $\lb \alpha, \beta \rb$ be an interval sublattice of $L$,
  %and $\lb \bar{\alpha}, \bar{\beta} \rb$ the corresponding  
 % interval of $\bar{L}$.
  %For ease of notation, let's rename $\bar{\alpha}$ and $\bar{\beta}$, dropping
  %the bars.  Thus $\lb \alpha, \beta \rb$ is the interval of interest and we
  %assume $\lb \alpha, \beta \rb\leq \Con \bA$.
  %The filter $\alpha^\uparrow =\lb \alpha, 1_A \rb$ 
  %s isomorphic to $\Con (\bA/\alpha)$, hence representable, so
  %by~(1) the dual $\partial (\alpha^\uparrow)=\lb 1_A', \alpha'\rb$ is also
  %representable. (Here $x'$ denotes the image of $x$ under dualization.)
 % Another quotient (this time by $\beta'$) gives a representation of
  %the interval $\lb \beta', \alpha'\rb$ above $\beta'$ in 
  %$\partial (\alpha^\uparrow)$. 
  %Since $\lb \beta', \alpha' \rb$  is the dual of $\lb \alpha, \beta \rb$, 
 % we apply~(1) once more to obtain the desired representation of 
 % $\lb \alpha, \beta\rb$.  Thus~(2) follows from~(1).

  \item By the ordinal sum of two lattices $L_1$, $L_2$, we mean the lattice
  on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:ord_par_fil-uni}.
  By the parallel sum of two lattices $L_1$, $L_2$, we mean the lattice
  in the middle of Figure~\ref{fig:ord_par_fil-uni}.

\item Item~\eqref{item:6} above is a very useful result which we will discuss further in
  Section~\ref{sec:union-filter-ideal} below, where we present a short proof of
  this fact.

\item Whether the class $\sL$ is closed under homomorphic images is open.

\subsection{Lattice duals: the theorem of Kurzweil and Netter}
\label{sec:duals-interv-subl-detail}
As mentioned above, 
the class $\sL$ -- the lattices isomorphic to congruence lattices of finite
algebras -- is closed under
dualization.
That is, if $L$ is representable, then so is the dual of $L$. This was proved in
1986 by Raimund Netter~\cite{Netter:1986}, generalizing the idea of his advisor,
Hans Kurzweil~\cite{Kurzweil:1985}. 
Though Kurzweil's article did appear,
%(in German), 
it is unclear whether Netter's
article was ever published.
In this section we present a proof of their result.
The argument requires a fair bit of machinery, but it is a nice idea and
well worth the effort.\footnote{We learned 
  of the main argument used in the proof from slides of a series of three
  lectures given by P{\'e}ter \Palfy in 2009~\cite{Palfy:2009}.
  \Palfy gives credit for the argument to Kurzweil and Netter.} 

If $G$ is a group and $X$ a set, then the set $\{f \mid f:X\rightarrow G\}$ of 
functions from $X$ into $G$ is denoted by $G^X$.  This is a group with binary
operation $(f,g) \mapsto f\cdot g$, where,  
for each $x\in X$, $(f\cdot g)(x)= f(x)g(x)$ is simply multiplication
in the group $G$.  The identity of the group $G^X$ is of course the constant map $f(x) =
1_G$ for all $x\in X$.

Let $X$ be a finite totally ordered set, with order relation $\leq$,
and consider the set $X^X$ of functions mapping $X$ into itself.  
The subset of $X^X$ consisting of unary
\emph{idempotent contractions}, that is, for all $x\in X$,
$f(f(x)) = f(x)$ and $f(x) \leq x$ for all $x\in X$. 
We denote this set by $\IC(X)$, so
\[
\IC(X) = \{f\in X^X \mid f^2 = f \text{ and }\; \forall x\; f(x) \leq x\}.
\]
Define the binary relation $\sqsubseteq$ on the set $\IC(X)$ by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MID111}
  f\sqsubseteq g \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \ker f \leq \ker g,
\end{equation}
where $\ker f = \{(x,y) \in X^2 \mid f(x) = f(y)\}$.
It is easy to see that $f\sqsubseteq g$ holds if and only if $gf = g$, and that
$\sqsubseteq$ is a partial ordering of $\IC(X)$.  
In fact, under this ordering, $\IC(X)$ is a lattice that is
isomorphic to $\bEqX$. The lattice isomorphism is the function
$\Theta : \EqX \rightarrow \IC(X)$ given by
$\Theta(\alpha) = f_\alpha$, where
$f_\alpha(x) = \min\{y\in X \mid x \mathrel{\alpha} y\}$.



Suppose $S$ is a finite nonabelian simple group, and consider the direct power $S^n$.
An element of $S^n$ may be viewed either as a function, $\bx : \nn \to S$,
from the set $\nn = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ to $S$, or as the tuple 
of its values, that is,
%
%% wjd: for the symbol denoting a tuple (x(0), x(1), ...), should we simply use
%% $x = (x(0), x(1),...)$ or should we use bold x? (currently using bold)
%
    $\bx = (x(0), x(1), \dots, x(n-1))$.
%
As a function, $\bx$ has kernel
\[
\ker \bx = \{(i,j) \in \nn^2 \mid x(i) = x(j)\}.
\]
The set of constant functions in $S^n$ is a subgroup $D < S^n$, sometimes called the
\defn{diagonal subgroup}; that is,
\[
D = \{(s, s, \dots, s) \mid s\in S\} \leq S^n.
\]
For each $f \in \IC(n)$, define
\[
%%
%% K_f = \{(x_{f(0)}, x_{f(1)}, \dots, x_{f(n-1)}) \mid x_{f(i)}\in S, \; i = 0, 1,\dots, n-1\}.
%% wjd: Why not call this S^n f?  Or simply Xf?  I don't remember my original
%%      motivation for calling it K_f.  I'm changing it.
%%      Complaints? (feel free to change it back or open an issue)
Xf = \{\bx f \mid \bx \in S^n\} =
\{(xf(0), xf(1), \dots, xf(n-1)) \mid \bx \in S^n\}.
\]
That is, $Xf$ is the set of all compositions of
$f$ followed by $\bx\in S^n$.
Thus, $Xf = \{ \by\in S^n \mid \ker f \leq \ker \by \}$.
For example, 
if $f = (0, 0, 2, 3, 2)\in \IC(\underline{5})$, then 
$\ker f$ is the equivalence relation corresponding to
the partition $|0,1|2,4|3|$, and 
$Xf$ is the subgroup of all
$\by = (y(0), y(1), y(2), y(3), y(4))\in S^5$ satisfying $y(0) = y(1)$ and
$y(2) = y(4)$. That is,
%% \begin{align*}
%% Xf &= \{\bx f \mid \bx\in S^5\} = \{(x(0), x(0), x(2), x(3), x(2)) \mid \bx\in S^5\}\\
%% &=\{\bx\in S^5 \mid \ker f \leq \ker \bx\}.
%% \end{align*}
\[Xf = \{(x(0), x(0), x(2), x(3), x(2)) \mid \bx\in S^5\}
=\{\by\in S^5 \mid \ker f \leq \ker \by\}.\]
It's not hard to see that $D \leq Xf\leq S^n$, for all $f\in \IC(n)$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:latt-duals}
  The map $f \mapsto Xf$ is a dual lattice isomorphism from $\bEq(n)$ onto the
  interval sublattice $\lb D, S^n\rb \leq \Sub(S^n)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This is clear since $\IC(n)$ is ordered by (\ref{eq:MID111}), and 
  we have 
  $f\sqsubseteq h$ if and only if
  $Xh = \{\by \in S^n \mid \ker h \leq \ker \by \}
  \leq \{\by \in S^n \mid \ker f \leq \ker \by \} =  Xf$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Kurzweil~\cite{Kurzweil:1985}, Netter~\cite{Netter:1986}]\
  \label{thm:duals-interv-subl}
  If the finite lattice $L$ is representable as the congruence lattice of a
  finite algebra, then so is the dual lattice $L'$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Without loss of generality, we assume that $L$ is represented
  as $L = \Con \<n, F\>$.
  Also, by \cite[Theorem~4.18]{alvi:1987}, we can assume
  that $F$ consists of unary operations: $F \subseteq n^n$.  
  As above, let $S$ be a nonabelian simple group
  and let $D$ be the diagonal subgroup of $S^n$.
  Then the unary algebra $\<S^n/D, S^n\>$  is a transitive $S^n$-set which
  has congruence lattice isomorphic to the interval $\lb D, S^n\rb$.
  (See, for example,~\cite[Lemma~4.20]{alvi:1987}.)
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:latt-duals}, this is the dual
  of the lattice $\bEq(n)$.  That is, 
  $\Con \<S^n/D, S^n\> \cong (\bEq(n))'$.
  
  Now, each operation $\phi \in F$ gives rise to an operation on $S^n$
  by composition:
  \[
  \hat{\phi}(\bx) =  \bx \phi = %\hat{\phi}(x(0), x(1)  \dots, x(n-1)) =
  (x(\phi(0)), x(\phi(1)),\dots, x(\phi(n-1))). 
  \]
  Thus, $\phi$ induces an operation on $S^n/D$ since, for 
  $\bd = (s, s, \dots, s) \in D$ and for $\bx \in S^n$, we have
  %$(\bx \bd)(i) = x(i)d(i) = x(i)s$, so
  \begin{align*}
  \bx \bd &= (x(0)d(0), x(1)d(1), \dots , x(n-1)d(n-1))\\
  &= (x(0)s, x(1)s, \dots , x(n-1)s).
  \end{align*}
  Therefore,
  \[\hat{\phi}(\bx \bd) =(x (\phi(0)) s, x(\phi(1))s, \dots , x(\phi(n-1))s)=
  \hat{\phi}(\bx) \bd,\]
  so $\hat{\phi}(\bx D)  = \hat{\phi}(\bx) D$.  Finally, add the set of operations 
  $\hat{F} = \{\hat{\phi} \mid \phi \in F\}$ to $\<S^n/D, S^n\>$, yielding the
  new algebra  $\<S^n/D, S^n \cup \hat{F}\>$, and observe
  that a congruence $\theta \in \Con\<S^n/D, S^n\>$ remains a congruence of
  $\<S^n/D, S^n \cup \hat{F}\>$ if and only if it corresponds to a partition on
  $n$ that is invariant under $F$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remarks}\
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    %% From the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:duals-interv-subl} we can see how
    %% large the algebra representing the dual of a lattice with be (assuming we
    %% use the method described in the proof).  
    If the original lattice $L$ is representable as the congruence lattice of
    an algebra with $n$ elements, then the method described in the proof of
    Theorem~\ref{thm:duals-interv-subl} above gives a representation of the dual
    $L'$ as the congruence lattice of the algebra
    $\<S^n/D, S^n \cup \hat{F}\>$, which has $|S^n/D| = |S|^{n-1}$ elements.
    Since the smallest simple nonabelian group is $A_5$, which has 60 elements,
    the resulting algebra with have at least $60^{n-1}$ elements.

    %% there corresponds a subgroup $Xf \in \lb D, S^n\rb$ such that

    %% Now if $\hat{\phi}\in \hat{F}$, then $(\hat{\phi}\bx, \hat{\phi}\by) \in \theta$ iff

    %% Better:
    take $\bz\in Xf$ with $\ker \bz = \ker f$, so $f(i)=f(j)$ iff
    $z(i) = z(j)$.
    Now suppose $\phi\in F$ does not respect $\ker f$, so there exists
    $(i,j) \in \ker f$ such that $(\phi(i), \phi(j)) \notin \ker f$.
    Then $\phi \bz \notin Xf$, since $z(\phi(i)) \neq z(\phi(j))$.

\subsection{Union of a filter and ideal}
\label{sec:union-filter-ideal}
The lemma in this section (Lemma~\ref{lemma:union-filter-ideal})
was originally proved by John Snow (see \cite{MR1774743} and \cite{MR2026829}),
using primitive positive
formulas.  Since it provides such a useful tool for proving that certain finite lattices 
are representable as congruence lattices, we give our own direct
proof of the result below. 

Before stating the lemma, we need a couple of definitions.  (These will be
discussed in greater detail in Section~\ref{sec:closure-method}.)
Given a relation $\theta \subseteq X\times X$, we say that the map 
$f: X^n\rightarrow X$ \emph{respects} $\theta$ and we write 
$f(\theta) \subseteq \theta$ provided $(x_i, y_i)\in \theta$ implies
$(f(x_1, \dots, x_n), f(y_1, \dots, y_n))\in \theta$.
For a set $L\subseteq \EqX$ of equivalence relations we define
\[
\lambda(L) = \{f\in X^X: (\forall \theta \in L) \; f(\theta) \subseteq \theta \},
\]
which is the set of all unary maps on $X$ which respect all relations in $L$.
\begin{lemma} 
  \label{lemma:union-filter-ideal}
  Let $X$ be a finite set.
  If $\bL \leq \bEqX$ is representable and $\bL_0\leq \bL$ is a sublattice with universe
  $\upalpha\cup \downbeta$ where $\upalpha=\{x\in L \mid \alpha \leq x\}$ and 
  $\downbeta=\{x\in L \mid x\leq \beta\}$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in L$, then $\bL_0$ is representable.
\end{lemma}

\end{center}
\caption{$L_0 \le L_1$}
\end{figure}

\vskip3mm

\begin{proof}
  Assume $\bL_0 \ncong \two$, otherwise the result holds trivially. 
  Since $\bL\leq \bEqX$ is representable, we have $\bL = \bCon
  \<X, \lambda(L)\>$ (cf.~Section~\ref{sec:closure-method}).  Take an arbitrary
  $\theta \in L \setminus L_0$. Since $\theta \notin \upalpha$, 
  % -- that is, $\alpha$ is not below $\theta$ --  
  there is a pair 
  $(a,b) \in \alpha \setminus \theta$.  Since $\theta \notin \downbeta$, there is
  a pair $(u,v)\in \theta\setminus \beta$. Define $h\in X^X$ as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:h}
    h(x) = \begin{cases}
      a,& \quad x\in u/\beta,\\
      b,& \quad \text{ otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  Then, $\beta \leq \ker h = (u/\beta)^2 \cup ((u/\beta)^c)^2$, where $(u/\beta)^c$ denotes the
  complement of the $\beta$ class containing $u$.  Therefore, $h$ respects every
  $\gamma \leq \beta$.  Furthermore, $(a, b) \in \gamma$ for all $\gamma \geq \alpha$,
  so $h$ respects every $\gamma$ above $\alpha$.  This proves that $h\in \lambda(L_0)$.
  Now, $\theta$ was arbitrary, so we have proved that for every $\theta \in L
  \setminus L_0$ there exists a function in $\lambda(L_0)$ which respects every
  $\gamma \in \upalpha\cup \downbeta = L_0$, but violates $\theta$.  Finally,
  since 
  $\bL_0 \leq \bL$, we have $\lambda(L)\subseteq \lambda(L_0)$.  Combining these
  observations, we see that every $\theta \in \EqX \setminus L_0$ is
  violated by some function in $\lambda(L_0)$. Therefore, $\bL_0 = \bCon \< X, \lambda(L_0)\>$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Ordinal Sums}
\label{sec:ordinal-sums}
%\todo{Revise this section.  Peter has written up some nice lemmas and
%  theorems on this topic which now appear below in a subsection called
%  ``Ordinal Sums II,'' but that material should be integrated with and/or
%  replace the material in this subsection.} 
For two lattices $L,M$ the \emph{adjoined ordinal sum}  
is denoted by $L\oplus_a M$ and is defined on $L\uplus (M\setminus\{0\})$
by $x\le y$ iff $x\in L,y\in M$ or ($x,y\in L$ and $x\le^L y$) or ($x,y\in M$
and $x\le^M y$). The \emph{ordinal sum} $L\oplus M$ is defined as $L\oplus_a\two\oplus_a M$.

The following theorem is a consequence of 
McKenzie's shift product construction~\cite{McKenzie:1984}. 
%, which we describebriefly below.
% \todo{Possibly add a short description of the shift product.}
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:ordinal-sums}
  If $L_1, \dots, L_n \in \sL$ is a collection of representable lattices, then
  the ordinal sum and the adjoined ordinal sum, shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:ord_adjord}, are representable.
\end{theorem}
A more direct proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:ordinal-sums} follows the argument given
by John Snow in~\cite{Snow:2000}.  As noted above, 
\Jiri \Tuma proved that
the class of finite representable lattices is closed under direct products.
Thus, if $L_1$ and 
$L_2$ are representable, then so is $L_1 \times L_2$.  Now note that the
adjoined ordinal sum of $L_1$ and $L_2$ is the union, $\alpha^\uparrow \cup
\beta^\downarrow$,  of a filter and ideal  
in the lattice $L_1 \times L_2$, where
$\alpha = \beta = 1_{L_1} \times 0_{L_2}$.  
Therefore, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:union-filter-ideal},
the adjoined ordinal sum is representable.  A trivial induction argument proves the
result for adjoined ordinal sums of $n$ lattices.  The same result for ordinal
sums (Figure~\ref{fig:ord_adjord} left) follows since the two element lattice is
obviously representable.

%\subsection{Ordinal Sums II}
%\todo{Merge this subsection with the subsection ``Ordinal Sums I.''}
%\newcommand{\m}{\mathbf}

Let $\bA,\bB$ be two finite algebras of cardinality $m$ and $n$ respectively,
and let $L=\bCon(\bA)$ and $M=\bCon(\bB)$. 
In \cite{Snow:2000} it is proved that $L\oplus_a M$ is isomorphic to the
congruence lattice of some finite algebra $\mathbf C$. Although the algebra $\mathbf C$ is
not explicitly constructed, it is based on the direct product of $\bA$ and $\bB$,
hence the ordinal sum is a sublattice of $\bEq(mn)$. Here we give a different
construction of $\mathbf C$ that leads to a tighter representation of $\bCon(\mathbf C)$ as
a sublattice of $\bEq(m+n-1)$.  
%If $\bA$ and $\bB$ are minimal-size algebras that have congruence lattices
%isomorphic to $\bL$ and $\bM$ respectively, then $\mathbf C$ will also be a
%minimal-size algebra with congruence lattice isomorphic to $\bL\oplus_a\bM$. 

Define a unary algebra $\bA_{m,n}$ with $m+n-1$ elements as follows: 
the base set is $A\uplus B_1$ where $A=\{a_0,\dots,a_{m-1}\}$,
$B_1=\{b_1,\dots,b_{n-1}\}$ and for each function $h:B_1\to A$ define a unary
operation 
$$\hat h(x)=\begin{cases}h(x)&\text{if $x\in B_1$}\\ 
x&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$

\begin{lemma}
  For $m,n\ge 1$ the lattice $\bCon(\bA_{m,n})$ is isomorphic to
  $\bEq(m)\oplus_a \bEq(n)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\alpha$ be the equivalence relation
  $A^2\cup\{(b_1,b_1),\dots,(b_{n-1},b_{n-1})\}$, so as a partition it is  
  $a_0,\dots,a_{m-1}|b_1|b_2|\dots|b_{n-1}$. 
  Note that $\bEq(m)\oplus_a \bEq(n)$ is isomorphic to the sublattice
  of $\bEq(A\uplus B_1)$ of all equivalence relations comparable to $\alpha$, since
  $\alpha$ has a unique non-singleton block of size $m$, and $n$ blocks
  altogether. We claim that this sublattice is the congruence lattice of $\bA_{m,n}$.  

  Suppose $\theta\le\alpha$, and let $(x,y)\in\theta$. Then $x,y\in A$ or $x=y$,
  hence for any operation $\hat h$ we  have $\hat h(x)=x$ and $\hat h(y)=y$ or
  $\hat h(x)=\hat h(y)$, so $(\hat h(x),\hat h(y))\in\theta$. 

  Suppose $\alpha\le\theta$, and let $(x,y)\in\theta$. Since $A^2\subseteq\alpha$
  and since the range of each $\hat h$ is $A$ it follows that 
  $(\hat h(x),\hat h(y))\in\theta$. 

  Now suppose $\theta$ is incomparable with $\alpha$. Then $A^2$ is not a subset
  of $\theta$, hence there exist $(x,y)\in A^2\setminus\theta$ and
  $(u,v)\in\theta\setminus\alpha$. If $u,v\in B_1$ then choose a function $h$ (as
  in the definition of $\bA_{m,n}$) such that $h(u)=x$ and $h(v)=y$, in which
  case $\hat h$ is an operation that shows $\theta$ is not a congruence. 
  If $u\in B_1$, but $v\in A$, note that we cannot have both $(x,v)$ and $(y,v)$
  in $\theta$ (else $(x,y)\in\theta$). Assume without loss of generality 
  that $(x,v)\notin\theta$ and choose $h$ such that $h(u)=x$, then again $\hat h$
  shows that $\theta$ is not a congruence. 
  The case $u\in A$, $v\in B_1$ is similar, and $u,v\in A$ is excluded since
  $(u,v)\notin\alpha$. 
\end{proof}

%\newpage

\begin{theorem}
  Suppose $\bA=\<A,F\>$ and $\bB=\<B,G\>$ are unary algebras with
  $A=\{a_0,\dots,a_{m-1}\}$, $B=\{b_0,\dots,b_{n-1}\}$ and 
  $A\cap B=\{a_0\}=\{b_0\}$ $($so $a_0,b_0$ are identified$)$. Let $\mathbf C$ be the
  algebra $\bA_{m,n}$ expanded with the operations 
  $$
  \hat f(x)=\begin{cases}f(x)&\text{if $x\in A$}\\
  f(a_0)&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\qquad\qquad
  \hat g(x)=\begin{cases}g(x)&\text{if $x\in B$}\\
  g(b_0)&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}
  $$
  for $f\in F$ and $g\in G$. Then $\bCon(\mathbf C)$ is isomorphic to
  $\bCon(\bA)\oplus_a\bCon(\bB)$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\mathbf C$ is an expansion of $\bA_{m,n}$ it follows from the preceding lemma
  that $\bCon(\mathbf C)$ is a sublattice of 
  $\{\theta\in \Eq(A\cup B):\theta\le\alpha$ or $\alpha\le\theta\}$ where,
  as before, $\alpha=A^2\cup\text{id}_B$. Note that $\alpha\in\Con(\mathbf C)$,
  so it suffices to show that $\{\theta\in\Con(\mathbf C):\theta\le\alpha\}$ is
  isomorphic to $\bCon(\bA)$ and $\{\theta\in\Con(\mathbf C):\theta\le\alpha\}$ 
  is isomorphic to $\bCon(\bB)$. The second isomorphism follows from the
  observation that $\mathbf C/\alpha$ is isomorphic to $\bB$ via the map 
  $A\mapsto b_0$ and $\{b_i\}\mapsto b_i$ for $i\ge 1$. For the first isomorphism,
  note that the operations $\hat g$, $\hat h$ preserve all equivalence relations
  below $\alpha$. Similarly it is straight forward to check that $\hat f$
  preserves $\theta\le\alpha$ iff $f$ preserves $\theta\cap A^2$. 
  Hence the map $\theta\mapsto\theta\cap A^2$ is the required isomorphism.
\end{proof}

Now assume $\bA$ and $\bB$ are minimal-size algebras with congruence lattices
isomorphic to $L$ and $M$ respectively. Then it seems likely that the
algebra $\mathbf C$ above is minimal in size with respect to having a congruence
lattice isomorphic to $L\oplus_a M$. Suppose $\mathbf C'$ is a smaller algebra
with the same congruence lattice, and let $\alpha$ be the congruence in the
``middle'' of the ordinal sum. Then $\mathbf C'/\alpha$ has a congruence lattice
isomorphic to $M$, hence $|\mathbf C'/\alpha|=|\bB|=$ number of blocks in
$\alpha$. However, $\alpha$ does not need to have a unique nontrivial block, so
it is not clear at this point how to obtain a smaller algebra $\bA'$ such that
$\bCon(\bA')$ is isomorphic to $L$.

\section{Concrete Representations}
\label{sec:concr-repr}
%%%% \input{inputs/concrete.tex} (include all major inputs in one file)
%% -- Begin concrete.tex file insertion -------------------------------

In this section, we introduce a strategy that has proven very useful for showing
that a given lattice is representable as a congruence lattice of a finite
algebra. We call it the \defn{closure method}, and it has become especially
useful with the advent of powerful computers which can search for such
representations.  Recall that  $\EqX$ denotes the lattice of equivalence
relations on $X$. Sometimes we abuse notation and take $\EqX$ to mean the
lattice of partitions of the set $X$. This never causes problems because these
two lattices are isomorphic.  

\subsection{Concrete versus abstract representations}
As Bjarni J\'onsson explains in~\cite{Jonsson:1972}, there are two types of
representation problems for congruence lattices, the concrete and the
abstract.  The \emph{concrete representation problem} asks whether a specific family of
equivalence relations on a set $A$ is equal to $\Con \bA$ for some
algebra $\bA$ with universe $A$.  The \defn{abstract representation problem}
asks whether a given lattice is isomorphic to $\Con \bA$ for some algebra~$\bA$.

These two problems are closely related, and have become even more so since the
publication in 1980 
of~\cite{Pudlak:1980}, in which Pavel \Pudlak\ and
\Jiri\ \Tuma\ prove that every finite
lattice can be embedded as a 
spanning sublattice\footnote{Recall, by a 
  \defn{spanning sublattice}
  of a bounded lattice $L_0$, we mean a sublattice $L\leq L_0$ that has the same top and
  bottom as $L_0$.  That is  $1_L = 1_{L_0}$ and $0_L = 0_{L_0}$.}
of the lattice $\EqX$ of equivalence relations on a finite set $X$.   
Given this result, we see that even if our goal is to solve the abstract
representation problem for some (abstract) lattice $L$, then
we can embed $L$ into $\EqX$ as $L\cong L_0\leq \EqX$, for some finite set
$X$, and then try to solve the concrete representation problem for $L_0$.  

A point of clarification is in order here.  The term 
\defn{representation} 
has become a bit overused in the literature about the finite lattice
representation problem.  On the one hand, given a finite lattice $L$, if there
is a finite algebra $\bA$ such that $L \cong \Con \bA$, then $L$ is called a
\defn{representable lattice}.  On the other hand, given a sublattice $L_0\leq \EqX$, 
if $L_0\cong L$, then $L_0$ is sometimes called a 
\defn{concrete representation}
of the lattice $L$ (whether or not it is the congruence lattice of an algebra).    
Below we will define the notion of a \defn{closed concrete representation}, and if we
have this special kind of concrete representation of a give lattice, then that
lattice is indeed representable in the first sense.

As we will see below, there are many examples in which a particular concrete
representation $L_0\leq \EqX$ of $L$ is not a congruence lattice of a
finite algebra.  (In fact, we will describe general situations in which we can
guarantee that there are no non-trivial\footnote{By a 
  \defn{non-trivial function} we mean a function that is
  not constant and not the identity.} operations which respect the equivalence
relations of $L_0$.)  This does not imply that $L \notin \sL$.  It may
simply mean that $L_0$ is not the ``right'' concrete representation of $L$, and
perhaps we can find some other $L \cong L_1\leq \EqX$ such that $L_1 = \Con
\<X, \lambda(L_1)\>$.

\subsection{The closure method}
\label{sec:closure-method}
The idea described in this section
first appeared in \emph{Topics in Universal Algebra}~\cite{Jonsson:1972}, pages
174--175, where J\'onsson states, ``these or related results were discovered
independently by at least three different parties during the summer and fall of
1970: by Stanley Burris, Henry Crapo, Alan Day, Dennis Higgs and Warren Nickols
at the University of Waterloo, by R.~Quackenbush and B.~Wolk at the University
of Manitoba, and by B.~J\'{o}nsson at Vanderbilt University.''

Let $X^X$ denote the set of all (unary) maps from the set $X$ to itself, and let 
$\EqX$ denote the lattice of equivalence relations on the set $X$.  If $\theta
\in \EqX$ and $h\in X^X$, we write $h(\theta) \subseteq \theta$ and say
that ``$h$ respects $\theta$'' if and only if for all $(x,y)\in X^2$ $(x,y)\in
\theta$ implies 
$(h(x),h(y)) \in \theta$.  If $h(\theta) \nsubseteq \theta$, we sometimes say
that ``$h$ violates $\theta$.''

For $L\subseteq \EqX$ define
\[
\lambda(L) = \{h\in X^X: (\forall \theta \in L) \; h(\theta) \subseteq \theta \}.
\]

For $H\subseteq X^X$ define
\[
\rho(H) = \{\theta \in \EqX \mid   (\forall h\in H) \; h(\theta) \subseteq \theta\}.
\]
The map $\rho \lambda$ is a \defn{closure operator} on $\Sub(\EqX)$.
That is, $\rho \lambda$ is
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{idempotent:}\footnote{In fact, $\rho \lambda \rho = \rho$ and 
  $\lambda \rho \lambda = \lambda$.} $\rho \lambda \rho \lambda = \rho \lambda$;
\item \emph{extensive:} $L \subseteq \rho \lambda (L)$ for every $L \leq \EqX$;
\item \emph{order preserving:} $\rho \lambda (L) \leq \rho \lambda (L_0)$ if $L \leq L_0$.
\end{itemize}
Given $L\leq \EqX$, if $\rho\lambda(L) = L$, then we say $L$ is a 
%\defn{closed sublattice of $\EqX$}, in which case we clearly have
\emph{closed} sublattice of $\EqX$, in which case we clearly have
\[L = \Con \<X, \lambda(L)\>.\]
This suggests the following strategy for solving the representation problem for a
given abstract finite lattice $L$: search for a concrete representation $L \cong
L_0\leq \EqX$,
compute $\lambda(L_0)$, compute $\rho\lambda(L_0)$, and determine whether 
$\rho\lambda(L_0) = L_0$.  If so, then we have solved the abstract representation
problem for $L$, by finding a \defn{closed concrete representation}, or simply
\emph{closed representation}, of $L_0$.  We call this strategy the \defn{closure method}.

We now state without proof a well known theorem which shows that the finite lattice
representation problem can be formulated in terms of closed concrete
representations (cf.~\cite{Jonsson:1972}).
\begin{theorem}\label{Concrete-thm-3}
  If $\bL \leq \bEqX$, then $\bL= \bCon\bA$ for some algebra 
  $\mathbf{A} = \langle X, F\rangle$ if and only if $\bL$ is closed.
\end{theorem}

%% In the remaining sections of this chapter, we consider various aspects of the
%% closure method and prove some results about it.  Later, in
%% Section~\ref{sec:seven-elem-latt}, we apply it to the problem of finding
%% closed representations of all lattices of small order.  
Before proceeding, we introduce a slightly different set-up than the
one introduced above that we have found particularly useful
for implementing the closure method on a computer. Instead of considering the
set of equivalence relations on a finite set, we work with the set of idempotent
decreasing maps.  These were introduced above in
Section~\ref{sec:duals-interv-subl-detail}, but we briefly review the definitions here
for convenience.

As above, given a totally ordered set $X$, 
%consider the subset of the set $X^X$ of all functions that map $X$ into itself.  
we let $\IC(X) = \{f\in X^X: f^2 = f \text{ and } f(x) \leq x\}$, and 
define the partial order $\sqsubseteq$ on this set as follows:
\[
f\sqsubseteq g \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \ker f \leq \ker g.  
\]
As noted above, 
this makes \icx into a lattice that is isomorphic to $\bEqX$.   
Define a relation $R$ on $X^X \times \icx$ as follows: 
\[
(h,f) \in R \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad (\forall (x,y) \in \ker f)\; (h(x),h(y))
\in \ker f.
\]
If $h\, R\, f$, we say that  $h$ \emph{respects} $f$.

Let $\sF = \power{\icx}$ and $\sH = \power{X^X}$ be partially ordered by set
inclusion, and define the maps 
$\lambda: \sF \rightarrow \sH$ and $\rho: \sH \rightarrow \sF$ as follows:
\[
\lambda(F) = \{h\in X^X: \forall f\in F,\, h\, R \,f\} \quad (F \in \sF)
\]
\[
\rho(H) = \{f\in \icx: \forall h\in H,\, h\, R\, f\} \quad (H \in \sH)
\]
The pair $(\lambda, \rho)$ defines a \defn{Galois correspondence} between
$\icx$ and $X^X$.  That is, $\lambda$ and $\rho$ are 
antitone %(order-reversing) 
maps such that $\lambda \rho \geq \id_{\sH}$ and $\rho
\lambda \geq \id_{\sF}$.  In particular, for any set $F \in \sF$ we have 
$F \subseteq \rho \lambda (F)$.  These statements are all trivial verifications, and
a couple of easy consequences are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $\rho\lambda\rho = \rho$ and $\lambda\rho \lambda= \lambda$,
\item $\rho \lambda$ and $\lambda \rho$ are idempotent.
\end{enumerate}

Since the map $\rho \lambda$ from $\sF$ to itself is idempotent, extensive, %($F \subseteq \rho \lambda (F)$) 
and order preserving, it is a 
\defn{closure operator} 
on $\sF$, and we say a set $F\in \sF$ is
\emph{closed} if and only if $\rho\lambda(F) = F$. Equivalently,
$F$ is closed if and only if $F = \rho(H)$ for some $H\in \sH$.

\todo{Cite Birkhoff result about every finite distributive lattice being the

\todo{We may want to omit the proof of Theorem 4.1}

A lattice $\bL$ is called 
\defn{strongly representable} 
if whenever $\bL \cong \bL_0 \leq \bEqX$ for some $X$ then there is an algebra based on $X$
whose congruence lattice is $\bL_0$.  In other words, \emph{every} 
distributive spanning sublattice of the lattice of equivalence relations on a finite set
$X$ is equal to the congruence lattice of an algebra $\<X, F\>$, for some
collection $F$ of operations on $X$.

\index{Berman, Joel} \index{Quackenbush, R.} \index{Wolk, B.}
\begin{theorem}[Berman~\cite{Berman:1970}, Quackenbush and Wolk~\cite{Quack:1971}]
  Every finite distributive lattice is strongly representable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remarks}
  By Theorem \ref{Concrete-thm-3} above, the result of Berman, Quackenbush and
  Wolk says, if $\bL$ is a finite distributive lattice then every embedding
  $\bL\cong \bL_0\leq \bEqX$ is closed. The following proof is only slightly
  shorter than to the original in~\cite{Quack:1971}, and the methods are similar. 
\end{remarks}

\begin{proof}
  Without loss of generality, suppose $\bL\leq \bEqX$. 
  Fix $\theta\in \EqX \setminus L$ and define 
  $\theta^* = \Meet \{ \gamma \in L \mid \gamma \geq \theta \}$ and 
  $\theta_* = \Join \{ \gamma \in L \mid \gamma \leq \theta \}$.
  Let $\alpha$ be a join irreducible in $L$ below $\theta^*$ and not below
  $\theta_*$. 
  Note that $\alpha$ is not below $\theta$.
  Let $\beta = \Join \{ \gamma \in L \mid \gamma \ngeq \alpha \}$.
  If $\beta$ were above $\theta$, then $\beta$ would be above $\theta^*$,
  and so $\beta$ would be above $\alpha$. But $\alpha$ is join prime, so $\beta$ is not
  above $\theta$. 

  Choose $(u, v) \in \alpha \setminus \theta$ and note that $u \neq v$.
  Choose $(x, y) \in \theta \setminus \beta$ and note that $x \neq y$.
  Let $B$ be the $\beta$ block of $y$ and define $h\in X^X$ as in~(\ref{eq:h}). Then it
  is clear that $h$ violates $\theta$, $h$ respects all elements in the sets
  $\upalpha = \{\gamma \in L: \alpha \leq \gamma\}$ and 
  $\downbeta = \{\gamma \in L: \gamma \leq \beta\}$, and $L = \upalpha \cup
  \downbeta$. Since $\theta$ was an arbitrary element of $\EqX \setminus L$, we can
  construct such an $h = h_\theta$ for each $\theta \in \EqX \setminus L$.  Let $\sH = \{h_\theta:
  \theta \in \EqX \setminus L\}$ and let $\mathbf{A}$ be the algebra 
  $\langle X, \sH\rangle$.  Then, $\bL =\bCon(\mathbf{A})$. % \rho(\sH)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TRANSITIVEGSETS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
Let $X$ be a finite set and consider the set $X^X$ of all maps from $X$ to
itself, which, when endowed with composition of maps and the identity mapping,
forms a monoid, $\<X^X, \circ, \id_X\>$.  The submonoid $S_X$ of all bijective
maps in $X^X$ is a group, the \defn{symmetric group on} $X$.  When the
underlying set is more complicated, or for emphasis, we denote the symmetric
group on $X$ by $\Sym(X)$.  When the  
underlying set isn't important, we usually write $S_n$ to denote the
symmetric group on an $n$-element set. 

If we have defined some set $F$ of basic operations on $X$, so that
$\bX = \<X, F\>$ is an algebra, then two other important submonoids of
$X^X$ are $\End \bX$, the set of maps in $X^X$ which respect all 
operations in $F$, and $\Aut \bX$, the set of bijective maps in  $X^X$ which
respect all operations in $F$.  It is apparent from the definition that
$\Aut\bX= S_X \cap \End \bX$, and  $\Aut\bX$ is a submonoid of $\End \bX$
and a subgroup of $S_X$.  These four fundamental monoids associated with the
algebra $\bX$, and their relative ordering under inclusion, are shown in the diagram
below.

Given a finite group $G$, and an algebra $\bX = \<X, F\>$, a
\index{representation!of a finite group}%
\emph{representation} of $G$ on $\bX$ is a group homomorphism
from $G$ into $\Aut\bX$.  That is, a representation of $G$ is a mapping
$\varphi : G \rightarrow \Aut\bX$ which satisfies $\varphi(g_1 g_2) =
\varphi(g_1) \circ \varphi(g_2)$, where (as above) $\circ$ denotes composition
of maps in $\Aut\bX$.

\subsection{Transitive $G$-sets}
A representation $\varphi : G \rightarrow \Aut\bX$ defines an action by $G$ on the
set $X$, as follows: $\phi(g): x \mapsto x^{\varphi(g)}$.  If $\varphi(G) \leq
\Aut\bX$
denotes the image of $G$ under $\varphi$, we call the algebra $\< X, \phi(G)\>$
a \defn{G-set}.
% \footnote{More 
% generally, a \Gset\ is sometimes defined to be a pair $(X, \varphi)$, where
% $\varphi$ is a homomorphism from a group into the symmetric group $S_X$, see
% e.g.~\cite{Suzuki:1982}.}   
The action is called
\index{transitive!action}%
\emph{transitive} if for each pair $x, y \in X$ there is some $g\in
G$ such that $x^{\phi(g)} = y$. 
A group that acts transitively on some set is called a 
\index{transitive!group}%
\emph{transitive group}.
(Without specifying the set, however, this term is meaningless, since
every group acts transitively on some sets and intransitively on others.)
A representation $\varphi$ is called \emph{transitive} if the resulting action
is transitive. 


A representation  $\varphi : G \rightarrow \Aut\bX$ is called 
\emph{faithful}
\index{faithful!representation}%
if it is a monomorphism, in which case $G$ is isomorphic to its image under
$\varphi$, which is a subgroup of $\Aut\bX$.  We also say, in this case, that
the group $G$ acts faithfully, and call it a \defn{permutation group}.


The \defn{degree} of a group action on a set $X$ is the
cardinality of $X$.
Finally, a \defn{primitive group} is a group that
contains a core-free maximal subgroup.

For our purposes the most important representation of a group $G$ is its action 
on the set of cosets of a subgroup.  That is, for any subgroup $H\leq G$,
we define a transitive permutation representation of $G$, which we
will denote by $\rho_H$.  Specifically, $\rho_H$ is a group homomorphism
from $G$ into the symmetric group $\Sym(G/H)$ of permutations on the set $G/H =
\{H, Hx_1, Hx_2, \dots \}$ of \emph{right} cosets of $H$ in $G$.  

When 
The action is simply right multiplication by elements of $G$. That is,
$(Hx)^{\rho(g)}= Hxg$.
% Clearly, $\rho(g_1 g_2) = \rho(g_1)\rho(g_2)$ for all $g_1,
% g_2 \in G$, so $\rho$ is a group homomorphism.
Each $Hx$ is a point in the set $G/H$, and the
\defn{point stabilizer} of $Hx$ in $G$ is defined by
$G_{Hx} = \{g\in G \mid Hxg = Hx \}$.  Notice that 
$G_H = \{g\in G \mid Hg = H \} = H$ is the point stabilizer of $H$ in $G$, and 
\[
G_{Hx} =\{g\in G \mid Hxgx^{-1}  = H \} = 
x^{-1} G_H x  = x^{-1} H x = H^x.
\]
Thus, the kernel of the homomorphism $\rho$ is 
\[
\ker \rho = \{g\in G \mid \forall x \in G,\; Hxg = Hx \} = 
\bigcap_{x\in G}G_{Hx} = \bigcap_{x\in G} x^{-1} H x  = \bigcap_{x\in G} H^x.
\]
Note that $\ker \rho$ is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ 
contained in $H$, also known as the \defn{core} of $H$ in $G$, which we denote
by $\core_G(H)$.

If the subgroup $H$ happens to be \defn{core-free}, that is,
$\core_G(H)=1$, 
then $\rho : G \hookrightarrow \Sym(G/H)$, an embedding, so 
$\rho$ is a faithful representation; hence $G$ is a permutation group.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GSETISOMORPHISMS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{$G$-set isomorphism theorems}
% \label{subsec:g-set-isomorphism}
% We have seen above that the action of a group on cosets of a subgroup $H$ is a
% transitive permutation representation, and the representation is faithful when
% $H$ is core-free. 
% The first theorem in this section states that every
% transitive permutation representation is of this form.
% (In fact, as we will see in Lemma~\ref{lem:intransitive-gsets} below, every permutation
% representation, whether transitive or not, can be viewed as an action on cosets.)

% First, we need some more notation. Given a \Gset\ $\bA = \<A, G\>$ and any
% element $a\in A$,  the set  
% $G_a = \{g\in G \mid ga = a\}$ 
% of all elements of $G$ which fix $a$ is a
% \index{stabilizer subgroup}
% subgroup of $G$, called the \emph{stabilizer of $a$ in $G$}.

% \begin{theorem}[1st \Gset\ Isomorphism Theorem]
% \label{thm:g-set-isomorphism1}
%   If $\bA = \<A, \barG\>$ is a transitive \Gset, then $\bA$ is
%   isomorphic to the \Gset 
%   \[
%   \Gamma :=  \<G/\stab{a}, \{\hat{\lambda}_g : g\in G\}\>
%   \]
%   for any $a\in A$.
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%   Suppose $\bA= \<A, \barG\>$ is a transitive \Gset, so 
%   $A = \{\barg a \mid  g\in G\}$ for any $a\in A$.  The operations of the \Gset\ $\Gamma$ are defined, for each $g\in G$ and each
%   coset $x \stab{a}\in G/\stab{a}$, by $\hat{\lambda}_g(x \stab{a}) = gx\stab{a}$. 

%   Let 
%   $\bG_\Lambda$ denote the \Gset\ $\<G, \{\lambda_g : g\in G\}\>$, that is,
%   the group $G$ acting on itself by left multiplication. 
%   Fix $a\in A$, and define $\varphi_a:G \rightarrow A$ by $\varphi_a(x) =
%   \barx(a)$ for 
%   each $x\in G$.  
%   Then $\varphi_a$ is a homomorphism
%   from 
%   $\bG_\Lambda$ 
%   into $\bA$ --
%   that is, $\varphi_a$ respects operations:\footnote{In general, if $\bA
%     =\< A, F\>$ and $\bB = \<B, F\>$ are two algebras of the same
%     similarity type, then   
%     $\varphi: \bA \rightarrow \bB$ is a homomorphism provided
%     \[
%     \varphi(f^\bA(a_1,\dots, a_n)) = f^\bB(\varphi(a_1),\dots,\varphi(a_n))
%     \]
%     whenever $f^\bA$ is an $n$-ary operation of $\bA$, $f^\bB$ is the
%     corresponding $n$-ary operation of $\bB$, and $a_1,\dots, a_n$ are arbitrary 
%     elements of $A$.  (Note that a one-to-one correspondence between the
%     operations of 
%     two algebras of the same similarity type is assumed, and required for the
%     definition 
%     of homomorphism to make sense.)
%   }
%   \[
%   \varphi_a(\lambda_g(x)) = \varphi_a(gx)= \overline{gx}(a)
%   = \barg \cdot \barx(a)
%   = \barg \varphi_a(x).
%   \]
%   Moreover, since $\bA$ is transitive, $\varphi_a(G) = \{\barg a \mid  g\in G\}
%   = A$, 
%   so $\varphi_a$ is an epimorphism.  Therefore,
%   $\bG_\Lambda/\ker \varphi_a \cong \bA$.  
%   To complete the proof, one simply checks that the two algebras $\bG_\Lambda
%   /\ker \varphi_a $ and $\Gamma$ are identical.\footnote{
%     Indeed, 
%     $\ker \varphi_a = \{(x,y) \in G^2 \mid  \varphi_a(x) = \varphi_a(y)\}$
%     and the  universe of $\bG_\Lambda /\ker \varphi_a$ is 
%     $G/\ker \varphi_a = \{x/\ker \varphi_a  \mid x\in G \}$. 
%      where for each $x\in G$
%   \begin{align*}
%     x/\ker \varphi_a &= \{y\in G  \mid  (x,y) \in \ker \varphi_a\}
%     = \{y\in G  \mid  \varphi_a(x) = \varphi_a(y)\}
%     = \{y\in G  \mid  \barx(a) = \bary(a)\}\\
%     &= \{y\in G  \mid  \id_{A}(a) = \overline{x^{-1}y}(a)\}
%     = \{y\in G  \mid  x^{-1}y \in \stab{a}\}
%     = x \stab{a}.
%   \end{align*}
%   These are precisely the elements of $G/\stab{a}$,
%   so the universes of $\bG_\Lambda /\ker \varphi_a$ and $\Gamma$ are
%   the same, as are their operations (left multiplication by $g\in G$).}
% \end{proof}

% The next theorem shows why intervals of subgroup lattices are so important for
% our work.
\begin{theorem}[\Gset\ Isomorphism Theorem]
  \label{thm:g-set-isomorphism2}
  Let $\bA = \<A, G\>$ be a transitive \Gset\ and fix $a\in A$.  
  Then the lattice $\Con \bA$ is isomorphic to the
  interval $\lb G_a, G\rb$ in the subgroup lattice of $G$.
\end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%     For each $\theta  \in \Con \bA$, let $H_\theta =\{g\in G \mid (g(a),a) \in
%     \theta\}$,  
%     and for each $H \in [G_a, G]$, let 
%     $(b, c) \in \theta_H$ mean there exist $g \in G$ and $h \in H$ 
%     such that $gh(a) = b$ and $g(a) =c$. 
%     If $g_1, g_2 \in H_\theta$, then 
%     \[
%     (g_2(a), a) \in \theta \quad \Rightarrow \quad (g_2^{-1} g_2(a), g_2^{-1}(a)) =
%     (a, g_2^{-1}(a)) \in \theta,
%     \]
%     so $(g_2^{-1}(a), a) \in \theta$, by symmetry.  Therefore,
%     $(g_1g_2^{-1} (a), g_1 (a)) \in \theta$, so 
%     $(g_1g_2^{-1} (a), (a)) \in \theta$, by transitivity. Thus $H_\theta$ is a
%     subgroup of 
%     $G$, and clearly  $G_a \leq H_\theta$. 
%     It is also easy to see that $\theta_H$ is a congruence of $\bA$.
%     The equality $H_{\theta_H}=H$ trivially follows from the definitions. 
%     On the other hand $(b, c) \in \theta_{H_\theta}$ if and only if there exist 
%     $g, h\in G$ for which $(h(a),a) \in \theta$ and
%     $b = gh(a)$, and $c = g(a)$. Since $G$ is transitive, it is equivalent 
%     to $(b, c) \in \theta$.
%     Therefore, $\theta_{H_\theta} = \theta$. Finally, $H_\theta \leq H_\phi$ if
%     and only if
%     $\theta \leq \phi$, so $\theta \mapsto H_\theta$ is an isomorphism
%     between $\Con \bA$ and $[G_a, G]$.
% \end{proof}

Since the foregoing theorem is so central to our work, we provide an alternative 
statement of it. This is the version typically found in group theory 
textbooks (e.g., \cite{Dixon:1996}).  Keeping these two alternative perspectives in
mind can be useful.

\begin{theorem}[\Gset\ Isomorphism Theorem, version 2]
  Let $\bA = \<A, \phi(G)\>$ be a transitive \Gset\
  and fix $a \in A$. Let $\sB$ be the set of all blocks $B$ that contain $a$.
  % Let $[\stab{a},G] \subseteq \Sub(G)$ denote the set of all subgroups of 
  % $G$ containing $\stab{a}$. 
  Then there is a bijection $\Psi :\sB \rightarrow \lb \stab{a},G\rb$ given by $\Psi(B)= G(B)$,
  with inverse mapping $\Phi: \lb \stab{a},G\rb \rightarrow \sB $ 
  given by $\Phi(H) = \{a^{\phi(h)}  \mid  h\in H\}$. 
  The mapping $\Psi$ is order-preserving in the sense
  that
  $B_1\subseteq B_2 \Leftrightarrow \Psi(B_1) \leq \Psi(B_2)$.
\end{theorem}

Briefly, the poset $\<\sB, \subseteq\>$ is order-isomorphic to the 
poset $\<[\stab{a},G], \leq\>$. 

\begin{corollary}
  Let $G$ act transitively on a set with at least two
  points. 
  Then $G$ is primitive if and only if each stabilizer $\stab{a}$ is a
  maximal subgroup of $G$.
\end{corollary}

Since the point stabilizers of a transitive group are all conjugate, 
one stabilizer is maximal only when all of the stabilizers are maximal. 
In particular, a regular permutation group is primitive if and only if it has
prime degree. 

Next we describe (up to equivalence) all transitive permutation
representations of a given group $G$.  
We call two representations (or actions) 
\index{equivalent representations}%
\emph{equivalent}
provided the associated $G$-sets are isomorphic. 
The foregoing implies that every transitive permutation representation of $G$ is
equivalent to $\hlambda_H$ for some subgroup $H \leq G$.  The following
lemma\footnote{Lemma 1.6B of \cite{Dixon:1996}.} 
shows that we need only consider a single representative $H$ from each of the
conjugacy classes of subgroups.  

\begin{lemma}
  Suppose $G$ acts transitively on two sets,
  $A$ and $B$.  Fix $a\in A$ and let $G_a$ be the stabilizer of $a$ (under the first
  action).  Then the two actions are equivalent
  if and only if the subgroup $G_a$ is also a stabilizer under the second action
  of some point $b\in B$. 
\end{lemma}

The point stabilizers of the action $\hlambda_H$ described above are the
conjugates of $H$ in $G$.  Therefore, the lemma implies that, for any two
subgroups $H, K \leq G$, the representations $\hlambda_H$ and $\hlambda_K$ are
equivalent precisely when $K = x Hx^{-1}$ for some $x\in G$. 
Hence, the transitive permutation representations of $G$ are given, up to
equivalence, by $\hlambda_{K_i}$ as $K_i$ runs over a set of representatives of
conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$.

\subsection{Extensions of the \Palfy \Pudlak Theorem}
In \cite{PalfyPudlak1980} P.~P. \Palfy and P.~\Pudlak showed the
following statements are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item
every finite lattice is representable, that is $\sL$ is all
finite lattices;
\item
every finite lattice is isomorphic to an 
interval in the subgroup lattice of some finite group.
\end{itemize}
They did this by giving lattice conditions which force the
nonconstant operations of a minimal
representation to be permutations which generate a transitive
group $\bG$.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:g-set-isomorphism2}
the congruence lattice of such an algebra is isomorphic to 
the interval $\lb G_a,G \rb$. 
Then they showed every finite lattice could be embedded 
as an interval into a finite lattice satisfying these conditions.
\marginpar{is mim rep defined?}
However their equivalence is not global: it is possible that there 
is a representable lattice which is not isomorphic to an interval
of the subgroup lattice of a finite group. So there are several 
interesting questions we can ask about a finite lattice
$\bL$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{question1}
Is $\bL$ representable (isomorphic to $\Con \bA$ for some finite algebra $\bA$)?
\item\label{question2}
If $\bL$ is representable, what is the minimum size of $\bA$ with $\bL \cong\Con \bA$?
\item\label{question3}
Is there a group $\bG$ of permutations on $A$ such that $\bL \cong \< A,G\>$?
\item\label{question4}
Is there a transitive group $\bG$ of permutations on $A$ such that $\bL \cong \< A,G\>$?
Equivalently is $\bL$ isomorphic an interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite group
(by Theorem~\ref{thm:g-set-isomorphism2}).
\item\label{question5}
If $\bL \cong \<A,G\>$ for a group $\bG$ what is the smallest such $\bG$?
\end{enumerate}
As we mentioned, it is possible that \eqref{question1} does not imply \eqref{question4} 
but certainly \eqref{question4} implies \eqref{question1}. Obviously we don't have 
an example of an $\bL$ satisfying \eqref{question1} but not~\eqref{question4}, but 
in general representing $\bL$ 
in the form of~\eqref{question4}
is more difficult. For example,
the lattices $\bL_6$ and $\bL_7$ diagrammed in Figure~\ref{fig:L6and7}
can be represented on algebras of size~6 (and no fewer)
but representing them with permutation groups is much harder; 
see Aschbacher~\cite{Aschbacher2008}.

\caption{$\bL_{6}$ and $\bL_7$}\label{fig:L6and7}
\end{figure}



Below we try to answer at least
some of these questions for small lattices. 
As mentioned above \Palfy and \Pudlak gave conditions on a lattice $\bL$ 
such that if $\bL \cong \Con \<A,F\>$ then the nonconstant elements of $F$ are 
permutations and the group they generate acts transitively on $A$. 
These conditions are
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
\item $\bL$ is simple.
\item For each $x \ne 0$ in $L$, there are elements $y$ and $z$
such that $x \join y = x \join z = 1$ and $y\meet z = 0$.
\item $|L|\ne 2$ and each element of $L$ that is not an atom or $0$ contains at
least four atoms.
\end{enumerate}
If (A) and (B) hold then all nonconstant elements of $F$ are permutations.

Let (B$'$) and (B$''$) be the conditions related to (B) found in McKenzie's
paper~\cite{McKenzie1983}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(B$'$)]
If $\varphi: L \to L$ is any meet-preserving map such that $\varphi(x) > x$ for
$x\ne 1$, then $\varphi(x) = 1$ for all~$x$.
\item[(B$''$)]
The coatoms of $\bL$ meet to $0$.
\end{enumerate}
Note that
\[
\text{(B)} \implies \text{(B$''$)}  \implies \text{(B$'$)}.
\]
Clearly (B$''$) implies (B$'$). To see that (B) implies (B$''$),
let $x$ be the meet of all the coatoms of $\bL$. If $x > 0$
then applying (B) gives $y$ and $z$ each joining with $x$ to $1$.
But $x\join y = 1$ implies $y = 1$. Similarly $z = 1$. But then
$0 = y \meet z = 1$.


McKenzie proves in~\cite{McKenzie1983} that, just like (A) and (B),
(A) and (B$'$) imply that all nonconstant members of $F$ are
permutation. We record this as a theorem.

\begin{theorem}[P\'alfy-Pudl\'ak \cite{PalfyPudlak1980}, McKenzie
\cite{McKenzie1983}]
Let $\bL$ be finite lattice and suppose $\bL \cong \Con \<A,F\>$
is a minimal representation. If $\bL$ satisfies \textup{(A)} and
\textup{(B$'$)} then
all the nonconstant members of $F$ are permutations. 
The same conclusion obtains if 
$\bL$ satisfies \textup{(A)} and either \textup{(B)} or
\textup{(B$''$)}.
\end{theorem}

As we mentioned, if condition (C) is also assumed to hold then
$F$ generates a transitive permutation group on $A$. 
This served well for the proof of the P\'alfy-Pud\'lak Theorem. 
But few lattices satisfy (C) so we seek something more general
that guarentees the action is transitive. To do this we investigate 
properites of $\Con \<A,G\>$ where $G$ is a group that acts
intransitively on~$A$. It turns out such lattices are rather rare.

\subsection{Intransitive group actions} 
Suppose $\bA = \< A,G\>$ is a $G$-set and let $\bA_i = \<A_i, G\>$, $i < k$,
be the minimal subalgebras of $\bA$; i.e.~each set $A_i$ is an orbit, or
one-generated subuniverse, of $\bA$. Define congruences on $A$ by the 
partitions
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\tau &= |A_0|A_1|\cdots|A_{k-1}| &&\quad\text{ (the blocks are the orbits)} \\
\tau_i &= |A_i| &&\quad\text{ (at most one nontrivial block) }\\
\gamma_i &= |A_i|A - A_i| &&\quad\text{ (exactly two blocks unless
$A_i = A$) }
\end{alignat*}
So $(a,b) \in \tau$ if and only if they both lie in the same orbit;
$(a,b) \in \tau_i$ if and only if $a = b$ or both lie in $A_i$;
$(a,b) \in \gamma_i$ if and only if both lie in $A_i$ or both don't.
We call $\tau$ the \defn{intransitivity congruence}; $G$ acts transitively
if and only if $\tau = 1$. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:intrans}
Let $\bA = \<A,G\>$, where $G$ is a group, be a finite algebra. 
Let $\tau$, $\tau_i$ and $\gamma_i$
be the congruences defined above and let $\theta \in \Con \bA$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item1}
$G$ acts transitively if and only if $\tau = 1_{\bA}$.
\item \label{item2}
The interval $\lb\tau,1_\bA\rb$ is isomorphic to $\operatorname{Eq}(k)$.
\item \label{item3}
The interval $\lb 0_\bA,\tau\rb$ is isomorphic to $\prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \Con(A_i)$.
\item\label{item4}
If, for some $i$, $\theta \ge \Join_{j \ne i} \tau_j$ then $\theta \ge \tau$
or $\theta \le \gamma_i$.
\item\label{item5}
If $\theta\meet \tau \prec \tau$  then $\theta \le \gamma_i$ for some~$i$.
\item\label{item6}
If $k>1$ and $|A_i| = 1$ for all $i$ except $0$ then every coatom of $\Con \bA$
lies above~$\tau$.
\item\label{item7}
If $k>1$ and $\lb 0_\bA,\tau\rb$ is directly indecomposable 
then every coatom of $\Con \bA$ lies above~$\tau$.
\item\label{item8}
If $k = 2$ and $|A_1| = 1$ then $\tau$ is a coatom and 
everything is comparable with it.
\item\label{item9}
If $\tau$ is a coatom and $\lb 0_\bA,\tau\rb$ is directly indecomposable
then everything is comparable with it.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\eqref{item1} is obvious. Since $G$ acts trivially on $\bA/\tau$,
$\Con (\bA/\tau)$ is the lattice of all partitions; that is, 
$\operatorname{Eq}(k)$. So~\eqref{item2} holds. For~\eqref{item3},
we map
$(\theta_0, \ldots, \theta_{k-1}) \in \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \Con(A_i)$
to $\theta_0 \cup \cdots \cup \theta_{k-1}$. It is straightforward to
to verify that this is an isomorphism into $\lb 0_\bA,\tau\rb$. The inverse
map sends $\theta \in \lb 0_\bA,\tau\rb$ to $(\theta_0, \ldots, \theta_{k-1})$,
where $\theta_i = \theta \cap (A_i \times A_i)$. The details are left to the reader.

For~\eqref{item4} note that if 
$\theta \not\le \gamma_i$, then
there are elements $a \in A_i$ and $b \notin A_i$ with
$(a,b) \in \theta$. Let $b \in A_j$. Of course $j \ne i$.
Let $a'$ be any other element in $A_i$. Then,
since $G$ acts transitively on $A_i$,
there is a  $\sigma \in G$ with $\sigma(a)  = a'$. Let $b' = \sigma(b)$
and note $b' \in A_j$ so $(b,b') \in \theta$ because $\theta \ge
\Join_{r\ne i} \tau_r \ge \tau_j$.
Now
$(a',b') = (\sigma a,\sigma b) \in \theta.$
So $(a,b)$, $(b,b')$ and $(a',b')$ are all in $\theta$. Hence
$(a,a') \in \theta$. Since $a'$ was arbitrary, we see
$\theta \ge \tau_i$. So $\theta \ge \tau$, as desired.

\eqref{item5} follows from~\eqref{item4}. If
$|A_i| = 1$ for $i> 0$ then $\tau_i = 0_\bA$ for these $i$'s. Hence
$\Join_{i\ne 0} \tau_i = 0_\bA$ and the result follows
from~\eqref{item4} again. If $\lb 0_\bA,\tau\rb$ is directly indecomposable, then,
by~\eqref{item3}, $|A_i| = 1$ for all but at most one~$i$. So~\eqref{item7}
follows from~\eqref{item6}.

For~\eqref{item8}, that $\tau$ is a coatom follows from~\eqref{item2}. 
By~\eqref{item6}, $\tau$ is the only coatom. The result follows from this.
\eqref{item9} follows from~\eqref{item8}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Examples}

We give some examples showing the uses of Theorem~\ref{thm:intrans}. 
In deciding if a lattice has a representation using an intransitive
permutation group, we consider the possibilities for~$\tau$. 
By \eqref{item2} of Theorem~\ref{thm:intrans} the filter above
$\tau$ must be isomorphic to a partition lattice. In particular,
if the lattice has no filter isomorphic to $\bM_3 \cong \operatorname{Eq}(3)$, then the 
only candidates for $\tau$ are the coatoms. When $\tau$ is a coatom, $k = 2$
by~\eqref{item2} and $\gamma_0 = \gamma_1 = \tau$

\begin{figure}[htb]
%\renewcommand{\dotsize}{1.5pt}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]

  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{$\bL_{14}$ (on the left) and $\bL_{15}$}\label{fig:L14and15}
\end{figure}


Consider the lattices $\bL_{14}$ and its dual $\bL_{15}$ 
of Figure~\ref{fig:L14and15}. Since neither
has $\bM_3$ as a filter, the only possibilities for $\tau$ are cotatoms. 
For $\bL_{14}$ the ideals below each of the coatoms is directly 
indecomposable so, by Theorem~\ref{thm:intrans}\eqref{item9}, 
it cannot be represented with a nontransitive permutation group. Conditions
(A) and (B$''$) do hold and hence a minimal representation of 
$\bL_{14}$ must be by a transitive group. (More precisely, if
$\bL_{14} \cong \Con \<A,F\>$ then the nonconstant members of $F$ generate 
a transitive permutation group.) In fact the first author has shown there is a 
subgroup $H$ of $A_6$ of index 90 so that the interval of subgroups of
$A_6$ containing $H$ (the lattice of overgroups of $H$ in $A_6$) is $\bL_{14}$.
Of course in this example the algebra has size 90; we do not
know if this is the smallest example.

On the other hand the leftmost coatom of $\bL_{15}$ is a candidate for 
$\tau$ and in fact $\bL_{15}$ is the congruence of
$\<A,F\>$ where $A = \{0,1,2,3\}$ and $F = \{f\}$ where $f$ is the double
transposition interchanging $0$ and $1$ and also $2$ and~$3$. 
Conditions (A) and (B$''$) hold here too so the nonconstant operations of a 
minimal representation must be permutation. Clearly $\<A,F\>$ is the minimal
representation.

As we shall outline below, we have shown every lattice of size at most~$7$
elements
is representable with only one possible exception: $\bL_{10}$ diagrammed 
in Figure~\ref{fig:L10}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
%\renewcommand{\dotsize}{1.5pt}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
    \input{inputs/tikz/L10.tex}
    %    \draw (bottom) node [right]{$L_{11}$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{$\bL_{10}$}\label{fig:L10}
\end{figure}

This lattice cannot be represented using an intransitive permutation group. 
By Theorem~\ref{thm:intrans}\eqref{item9}, $\tau$ cannot be the leftmost or rightmost
coatom. Suppose $\tau$ is the middle coatom.  
As mentioned above this implies
$\gamma_0 = \gamma_1 = \tau$. Letting $\theta$ be the rightmost coatom we 
see that \eqref{item5} is violated. 
$\bL_{10}$ satisfies (A) and (B$''$) and thus a minimal representation, if one 
exists, must be by a transitive permutation group.

In Figure~XXXX below all nondistributive lattices
of size 7 or less which are not an ordinal sum are diagrammed. 
Very few of these can have a representation using a nontransitive
group. The lattices $\bL_2 = \bM_3$, $\bL_5$, $\bL_{15}$, 
and $\bL_{34}$ can be represented with an intransitive group. 
The algebra given in the figure for $\bL_5$ is a minimal 
representation and does not generate a group. But it does 
have an intranstive representation on a six element set with
the operations $(1,2,0,4,5,3)$ and $(0,1,2,3,5,4)$. 

Using techniques similar to those above, one
can prove that all of the remaining lattices cannot
have a represnetation with an intransitive group.
The one difficult case is $\bL_{19}$ of Figure~\ref{fig:L19}.
Lemma~\ref{lemma:complements} below covers this case.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:complements}
Let $\bA = \<A,G\>$ be a finite algebra, where
$G$ is an instransitive group of permutations on $A$.
Suppose the intransitivity congruence $\tau$ is a coatom.
Then there do not exist congruences
$0_\bA < \psi < \theta$ in $\Con \bA$
with $\theta \meet \tau = 0_\bA$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\tau$ is a coatom, there are exactly two orbits; call
them $B$ and $C$. Since $\theta \meet \tau = 0_\bA$, if
$(x,y) \in \theta$ then $x=y$ or one is in $B$ and the other
is in $C$. So $\theta$ defines a bipartite graph between
$B$ and $C$. Since $G$ acts transitively on both $B$ and $C$,
this graph corresponds to a bijection between $B$ and $C$. 
The same applies to $\psi$. But equivalence relations
corresponding to such graphs cannot be comparable.
\end{proof}




In \cite{Shareshian2003} John Shareshian gave a class of finite lattices that
he conjectured could not be represented as intervals in subgroup lattices.
They are easy to describe. Let $m_1 \ge \cdots \ge m_t \ge 3$ with $t> 1$.
Take the set $\{\two^{m_i} \mid 1\leq i \leq t\}$ of 
lattices of subsets of sets of sizes $m_i$ for each $i\in \{1,\ldots,t\}$, remove
the least and greatest element of each, line them up side by side, and adjoin
them into one large lattice by giving them all a new common least element and a
new common greatest element. While the conjecture---that this lattice is not
representable as a congruence lattice of a finite algebra---is still open, much
progress has been made, primarily by Aschbacher; see~\cite{Aschbacher2013}.
For example, the problem has been reduced to almost simple groups.


Arguments similar to those used above to analyze $\bL_{10}$
also show that a minimal representation of one of Shareshian's
lattices could not come from an \emph{intransitive} permutation group.
This is because such lattices satisfy conditions (A) and (B$''$),
so a minimal representation, if it exists, would have to be
the congruence lattice of a transitive $G$-set.
Hence, if one of Shareshian's lattices does not occur as an
interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite group, then that lattice has
no finite representation at all.

%\subsubsection{$L_{11}$}
%\label{sec:l11}

Next consider $\bL_{11}$ diagrammed in Figure~\ref{fig:L11} (left). Again, we
can use Theorem~\ref{thm:intrans}\eqref{item9} to show that it's not possible to
represent $\bL_{11}$ using an intransitive permutation group. However (A) and
(B$'$) do not hold in this case, so we cannot conclude that a minimal representation
must come from a transitive permutation group. Nevertheless, with some help from
\gap, we are able to show that it can be represented as an interval
in the lattice of subgroups of a group. We do not know if this is the
smallest representation.

\caption{$\bL_{11}$ (left) and an upper interval (right)}\label{fig:L11}
\end{figure}
Start with the group representation of the pentagon as the upper
interval $\lb H, G\rb$ where $G \cong ((C_3 \times C_3) : Q_8) : C_3$ and 
$H \cong C_6$.
Here $C_k$ denotes the cyclic group of order $k$, $Q_8$ denotes the
quaternion group of order 8, and {\tt :} denotes the usual semidirect product.
We let $\alpha \prec \beta$ and $\gamma$ denote the three subgroups inside the
pentagon $\lb H, G \rb$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:L11} (right).

The entire subgroup lattice $\Sub(G)$ is the congruence lattice of an
algebra. Therefore, if there is a minimal subgroup $K$ ($1 \prec K \leq G$) that
is below $\beta$, but not below  $\alpha$ or $\gamma$, then lattice $L_{11}$ is the 
union of the ideal $\lb 1, K\rb$ and the filter $\lb H, G\rb$.
Luckily, there is such a subgroup $K$. We can check this fact using \gap, as we now describe.
A search of the \gap Library of Small Groups finds that the 153rd
isomorphism class of groups of order 216---that is, the group 
returned by the function call \code{SmallGroup( 216, 153 )}, which happens to have
structure description $((C_3 \times C_3) : Q_8) : C_3$.
Upon inspection of the conjugacy classes of subgroups of this group, we 
find that the representative of the 8th class is a suitable candidate for 
$H$, so we define 

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
    G := SmallGroup( 216, 153 );;    
    ccsg := ConjugacyClassesSubgroups( G );;
    H := Representative( ccsg[8] );;
    intHG := IntermediateSubgroups( G, H );
\end{verbatim}
}

\noindent 
The last of these commands results in the following output:

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
    rec( 
      subgroups := [ 
         Group([ f1, f4, f5*f6 ]), Group([ f1, f2, f3*f4, f4 ]), 
         Group([ f1, f4, f5, f6 ]) 
      ], 
      inclusions := [ 
         [ 0, 1 ], [ 0, 2 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 3, 4 ] 
      ] 
    )
\end{verbatim}
}

\noindent This is a record where the {\tt subgroups} field is a list of
the subgroups $K$ that lie strictly between $H$ and $G$, that is, $H < K < G$,
and the {\tt inclusions} field indicates the covering
relations among the subgroups.
\gap uses indices $0, 1, \dots, 4$ to label the subgroups 
in $\lb H, G\rb$, and the correspondence is given in the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
%0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
4 & $G$\\
\hline
3 & \code{Group([ f1, f4, f5, f6 ])} \\ 
\hline
2 & \code{Group([ f1, f2, f3*f4, f4 ])}\\ 
\hline
1 & \code{Group([ f1, f4, f5*f6 ])}\\
\hline
0 & $H$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent 
In the \code{inclusions} field the entry \code{[ 1, 3 ]}, for example,
indicates that \code{Group([ f1, f4, f5*f6 ])} is a maximal subgroup of 
\code{Group([ f1, f4, f5, f6 ])}.
So, the \gap output above shows that the interval 
$\lb H, G \rb$ is a pentagon.

Next, we define the following groups in \gap:

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
A:=intHG.subgroups[1];  B:=intHG.subgroups[3];  C:=intHG.subgroups[2];
\end{verbatim}
}
Here, \code{A} $<$ \code{B} are the comparable generators of the pentagon
and \code{C} is the incomparable generator.
We consider the conjugacy classes of the subgroups of \code{B}
(using the \gap command \code{ccsgB:=ConjugacyClassesSubgroups(B);})
and by looking at the subgroup lattice in \xgap, we notice that 
there is a conjugacy class of subgroups of \code{B} containing six
subgroups each of index 72 in \code{G} (order 3), and the subgroups
in this class are not subgroups of \code{A} or \code{C}.

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
List(ccsgB, x->Size((x)));
# returns [ 1, 9, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 9, 9, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1 ]
List(ccsgB, x->Order(Representative(x)));
# returns [ 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 18, 18, 27, 54 ]
\end{verbatim}
}
Thus the only conjugacy class of size 6 whose elements 
have order 3 is the sixth class.  So let
\code{K:=Representative(ccsgB[6]);}.
Note that \code{K} is a minimal subgroup since $|K|=3$.  Finally,
check that \code{K} is a subgroup of \code{B}, and not a subgroup of
\code{A} or \code{C}:
{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
IsSubgroup(A,K);  # returns false
IsSubgroup(B,K);  # returns true
IsSubgroup(C,K);  # returns false
\end{verbatim}
}
This shows lattice $\bL_{11}$ is representable on a set of size 216.
In this example, where $\lb H,G \rb$ is the pentagon, the index is $\lb G:H \rb=36$.  

Now, there might be a nontrivial subgroup $M < H$ such that in the interval
$\lb M, G \rb$ there is a union of a filter and ideal in $\Sub(G)$ that is isomorphic to
$\bL_{11}$. This would give us a representation of $\bL_{11}$ on smaller set than 216.
Indeed, looking at the subgroup lattice of $G$ in \xgap, we see that, 
$H$ has only two nontrivial proper subgroups.  These are

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
M1:=Representative(ccsgB[2]);
M2:=Representative(ccsgB[4]);
IsSubgroup(H,Representative(ccsgB[2]));  # returns true
IsSubgroup(H,Representative(ccsgB[4]));  # returns true
\end{verbatim}
}
We need to find a subgroup that covers one of these two subgroups
and is not below \code{A} or \code{C}.
{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
intM1B:=IntermediateSubgroups(B,M1);
# returns 
#  rec( 
#    subgroups := [ 
#      Group([ f4, f5 ]), Group([ f4, f6 ]), 
#      Group([ f1^2, f4 ]), Group([ f4, f5*f6 ]), 
#      Group([ f4, f5^2*f6 ]), Group([ f4, f5, f6 ]), 
#      Group([ f1^2, f4, f5*f6 ]) 
#    ], 
#    inclusions := [ 
#      [ 0, 1 ], [ 0, 2 ], [ 0, 3 ], [ 0, 4 ], 
#      [ 0, 5 ], [ 1, 6 ], [ 2, 6 ], [ 3, 7 ], 
#      [ 4, 6 ], [ 4, 7 ], [ 5, 6 ], [ 6, 8 ], [ 7, 8 ] 
#    ] 
#  )
\end{verbatim}
}
\code{M1} is maximal in the intermediate subgroups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
We now check whether these are subgroups of \code{A} or \code{C}.

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
IsSubgroup(A,intM1B.subgroups[1]);   # returns false
IsSubgroup(B,intM1B.subgroups[1]);   # returns true (of course)
IsSubgroup(C,intM1B.subgroups[1]);   # returns false
\end{verbatim}
}
So $\bL_{11}$ is the union of $\lb${\code{M1, intM1B.subgroups[1]}$\rb$
and $\lb H, G \rb$, and the command \code{Index(G,M1);} returns 108,
so we have a representation of $\bL_{11}$ on 108 elements.

Next consider \code{M2}.

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
Index(G,M2);  # returns 72
intM2B:=IntermediateSubgroups(B,M2);
# returns 
#  rec( 
#    subgroups := [ 
#        Group([ f1, f4 ]), Group([ f1, f4*f5*f6 ]), 
#        Group([ f1, f4*f5^2*f6^2 ]), Group([ f1, f5*f6 ]), 
#        Group([ f1, f4, f5*f6 ]), Group([ f1, f4*f5, f5^2*f6^2 ]), 
#        Group([ f1, f4*f6, f5*f6 ]), Group([ f1, f5, f6 ]) 
#    ], 
#    inclusions := [ 
#        [ 0, 1 ], [ 0, 2 ], [ 0, 3 ], [ 0, 4 ], [ 1, 5 ], 
#        [ 2, 5 ], [ 3, 5 ], [ 4, 5 ], [ 4, 6 ], [ 4, 7 ], 
#        [ 4, 8 ], [ 5, 9 ], [ 6, 9 ], [ 7, 9 ], [ 8, 9 ] 
#    ] 
#  )
\end{verbatim}
}
So \code{M2} is maximal in the intermediate subgroups 1, 2, 3, and 4.
We can check whether one of these is not a subgroup of \code{A} or \code{C}:

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
IsSubgroup(A,intM2B.subgroups[1]);   # returns true
IsSubgroup(C,intM2B.subgroups[1]);   # returns true

IsSubgroup(A,intM2B.subgroups[2]);   # returns true
IsSubgroup(C,intM2B.subgroups[2]);   # returns false

IsSubgroup(A,intM2B.subgroups[3]);   # returns true
IsSubgroup(C,intM2B.subgroups[3]);   # returns false

IsSubgroup(A,intM2B.subgroups[3]);   # returns true
IsSubgroup(C,intM2B.subgroups[3]);   # returns false
\end{verbatim}
}
So, using this method and this group, the smallest set on 
which we can represent $\bL_{11}$ is 108.

\todo{complete this section: perhaps we should actually perform the closure, get
  the operations and produce the algebra that has $\bL_{11}$ as a
  representation (although, this is not absolutely necessary since the above
  suffices to prove that $\bL_{11}$ is, in indeed, representable).}


\subsection{Minimal Representations}
In this section we consider what it means to say that
a congruence lattice representation of a finite lattice is in some sense
\emph{minimal}.
It seems most natural to say that a representation $\Con \bA \cong \bL$
is a \defn{minimal representation of} $\bL$ if the size
$|A|$ of the universe of $\bA$ as small as possible. That is, we have a proof
that no representation on a smaller algebra is possible.

There is, however, a separate notion of smallness of a representation that might
be worth considering.  Suppose we know that a lattice $\bL$ is representable as
an upper interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite.  We could ask, ``what is
the smallest group $G$ such that $\bL \cong \lb H, G \rb$ for some $H\leq G$?''
However, a more relevant question might be, ``what is the smallest number $n$
such that there are finite groups $H\leq G$ with index $n = [G:H]$ and 
satisfying $\bL \cong \lb H, G \rb$?''  The reason this question seems more
natural is obvious. The resulting algebra that represents $\bL$ is the group
$G$ acting on the set of cosets of $H$, and this algebra has $n = [G:H]$
elements.  In this context, the index seems more relevant that the size of the
group $G$.

Now suppose we find that $G$ is the smallest group in whose subgroup lattice
$\bL$ appears as an upper interval. It is possible that there is a larger group
in whose subgroup lattice $\bL$ appears, but with a smaller index.
Here is an example of this phenomenon.

An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:10} which shows
the $\two\times \two$ lattice as the upper interval
$\lb C_2, C_3 \times S_3\rb$, as well as the upper interval
$\lb \<e\>, C_{10}\rb$. Of course, the groups $C_{10}$ and
$C_3 \times S_3$ have orders 10 and 18, respectively, but
the respective indices are
$|C_{10}:\<e\>| = 10$ and $|C_3 \times S_3:C_2|=9$.
This example shows that we can sometimes represent the same lattice
with a smaller algebra by using a group of larger order.

\section{Small unary algebras for congruence lattices of size $\le 7$}
%%%% \input{inputs/conglattices7.tex}  (include all major inputs in one file)
%% -- Begin conglattices7.tex file insertion -------------------------------

Distributive lattices and lattices that are ordinal sums of smaller lattices are omitted. This leaves 35 lattices listed below with the names $\bL_1,\ldots,\bL_{35}$. In most cases, each lattice $\bL_i$ is followed by a
unary algebra denoted $\bB_i$ with the property that $\bL_i=\Con(\bB_i)$.
The base set of each algebra is $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$, and each unary operation $f,g,h,\ldots$ is
specified by a vector of values of these elements.  Algebras of size less than
$11$ \marginpar{PJ: should this be less than or equal to 11???} are known to be minimal-size algebras that produce the corresponding
congruence lattice. The algebra $\bB_{33}$ is also known to be minimal in
size. Currently only $\bL_{10}$ is not known to be the congruence
lattice of a finite algebra. 

%Thirteen of the 35 lattices below are subdirectly reducible (specifically: 6, 7,12, 13, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35).
