# fin-lat-rep

This repository collects some resources for preparing the article on
representing small lattices as congruence lattices of finite algebras.  The
LaTeX files for the article itself are in the
[article directory](https://github.com/UniversalAlgebra/fin-lat-rep/tree/master/article).

For questions, comments, or suggestions please [submit an issue][].

Authors can also use the [issue tracker][] to keep track of todo items.

Thanks for your interest in this work!
