\todo{Cite Birkhoff result about every finite distributive lattice being the
  congruence lattice of a finite lattice.}

A lattice $\bL$ is called 
\defn{strongly representable} 
if whenever $\bL \cong \bL_0 \leq \bEqX$ for some $X$ then there is an algebra based on $X$
whose congruence lattice is $\bL_0$.  In other words, \emph{every} 
distributive spanning sublattice of the lattice of equivalence relations on a finite set
$X$ is equal to the congruence lattice of an algebra $\<X, F\>$, for some
collection $F$ of operations on $X$.

\begin{theorem}[Berman~\cite{Berman:1970}, Quackenbush and Wolk~\cite{Quack:1971}]
  Every finite distributive lattice is strongly representable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remarks}
  By Theorem \ref{Concrete-thm-3} above, the result of Berman, Quackenbush and
  Wolk says, if $\bL$ is a finite distributive lattice then every embedding
  $\bL\cong \bL_0\leq \bEqX$ is closed. The following proof is only slightly
  shorter than to the original in~\cite{Quack:1971}, and the methods are similar. 
\end{remarks}

\begin{proof}
  Without loss of generality, suppose $\bL\leq \bEqX$. 
  Fix $\theta\in \EqX \setminus L$ and define 
  $\theta^* = \Meet \{ \gamma \in L \mid \gamma \geq \theta \}$ and 
  $\theta_* = \Join \{ \gamma \in L \mid \gamma \leq \theta \}$.
  Let $\alpha$ be a join irreducible in $L$ below $\theta^*$ and not below
  $\theta_*$. 
  Note that $\alpha$ is not below $\theta$.
  Let $\beta = \Join \{ \gamma \in L \mid \gamma \ngeq \alpha \}$.
  If $\beta$ were above $\theta$, then $\beta$ would be above $\theta^*$,
  and so $\beta$ would be above $\alpha$. But $\alpha$ is join prime, so $\beta$ is not
  above $\theta$. 

  Choose $(u, v) \in \alpha \setminus \theta$ and note that $u \neq v$.
  Choose $(x, y) \in \theta \setminus \beta$ and note that $x \neq y$.
  Let $B$ be the $\beta$ block of $y$ and define $h\in X^X$ as in~(\ref{eq:h}). Then it
  is clear that $h$ violates $\theta$, $h$ respects all elements in the sets
  $\upalpha = \{\gamma \in L: \alpha \leq \gamma\}$ and 
  $\downbeta = \{\gamma \in L: \gamma \leq \beta\}$, and $L = \upalpha \cup
  \downbeta$. Since $\theta$ was an arbitrary element of $\EqX \setminus L$, we can
  construct such an $h = h_\theta$ for each $\theta \in \EqX \setminus L$.  Let $\sH = \{h_\theta:
  \theta \in \EqX \setminus L\}$ and let $\mathbf{A}$ be the algebra 
  $\langle X, \sH\rangle$.  Then, $\bL =\bCon(\mathbf{A})$. % \rho(\sH)
\end{proof}
