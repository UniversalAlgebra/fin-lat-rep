\title{Representing Small Lattices as \\Congruence Lattices of Finite Algebras}

\date{10 June 2015 (draft 1)}
\begin{abstract}
  We give a brief overview of various known methods for
  representing a finite lattice as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra or
  proving that such a representation exists.
  Using these and a recently discovered method, we show, for all but one lattice,
  that every lattice with at most seven elements is isomorphic to the congruence
  lattice of a finite algebra.
